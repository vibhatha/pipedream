#
# This example Dockerfile illustrates a method to apply
# patches to the source code in NVIDIA's PyTorch
# container image and to rebuild PyTorch.  The RUN command
# included below will rebuild PyTorch in the same way as
# it was built in the original image.
#
# By applying customizations through a Dockerfile and
# `docker build` in this manner rather than modifying the
# container interactively, it will be straightforward to
# apply the same changes to later versions of the PyTorch
# container image.
